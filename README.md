HI guys, My Name is Arpan. Currently I am parsuing MCA from Brainware University.
I made this simple website using HTML CSS & JavaScript.
In future There will be more surprise update(Coming Soon).
This is a simple music player where you can listen to some music.
Note that there is no  vast library. But You can download and add your favourite music.
In this project you can play pause music. Previous and next song action. And you can select the mucic by clicking on the song name on list.
You can animate the disc icon by play pause button.
Here is the screenshot of the project.
